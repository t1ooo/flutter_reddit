The primary outcomes, measured in a subset of subjects, were the Malawi Developmental Assessment Tool (MDAT) global and 4 domain (gross motor, fine motor, language and social) z-scores and a modified Willatts problem solving assessment (PSA) intention score for 3 standardized problems, measured 6 months and immediately after completing RUTF therapy, respectively. Plasma fatty acid content, anthropometry and eye tracking were secondary outcomes. Comparisons were made between the novel PUFA RUTFs and S-RUTF.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nResults\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAmong the 2565 SAM children enrolled, global MDAT z-score was -0.69 ± 1.19 and - 0.88 ± 1.27 for children receiving DHA-HO-RUTF and S-RUTF, respectively (difference 0.19, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.38). The gross motor and social domains had higher z-scores among children receiving either DHA-HO-RUTF than S-RUTF. The PSA problem 3 scores did not differ by dietary group (Odds ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.26 for DHA-HO-RUTF). After 4 weeks of treatment, plasma phospholipid EPA and α-linolenic acid were greater in children consuming DHA-HO-RUTF or HO-RUTF when compared to S-RUTF (for all 4 comparisons P values &lt; 0.001), but only plasma DHA was greater in DHA-HO-RUTF than S-RUTF (P &lt;0.001).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConclusions\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTreatment of uncomplicated SAM with DHA-HO-RUTF resulted in an improved MDAT score, conferring a cognitive benefit six months after completing diet therapy. This treatment should be explored in operational settings.\n\nSevere acute malnutrition (SAM) afflicts up to 20 million children annually and has nearly always been considered mainly for its impairment of body growth and associated morbidity and mortality risks. In this issue of The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, Mark Manary of Washington University in St Louis, Tom Brenna of the University of Texas at Austin and Cornell University, and many coworkers present the first data showing that the fatty acids of lipid-rich ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTFs) are central to long-term brain recovery from SAM (1). Correcting excess ω-6 linoleic acid and deficits of ω-3 α-linolenic acid and DHA lead to sustained improved performance in developmental aptitude tests 6 months after the conclusion of successful treatment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs far as I am aware, this trial by Marcy et al. is the first to use cognition as a primary outcome in the treatment of severe acute malnutrition. For too long, malnutrition in Africa has been considered as just protein–calorie malnutrition. For example, Kwashiorkor has been treated with protein and calories, with a large portion of the calories coming from vegetable oils rich in linoleic acid, the parent essential fatty acid in the ω-6 family. Little thought seems to have been given to α-linolenic acid, an equivalent parent of the ω-3 family, despite the fact that their essentiality was established in the 1970s, with the need for a balance in the diet being referred to in a joint FAO/WHO expert consultation on “The Role of Dietary Oils and Fats in Human Nutrition” in 1976 (2). It has been well established that these 2 families of essential fatty acids use the same enzyme systems and too much of one competes against others, a process that is now understood on a genetic and molecular level (3). An excess of omega 6 linoleic acid suppresses tissue accretion of all omega 3 fatty acids. The metabolic demand for omega 3 induced by high linoleic acid consumption impairs development of the brain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVegetable oils often contain high amounts of linoleic acid, which can reduce the bioavailability of omega 3 fats. This is of particular concern because the principal omega 3 product is DHA. This fatty acid is a vital component of the visual and neural receptors and signaling systems. The function of DHA in vision and the brain has been highly conserved since the origin of air-breathing animals (4, 5). Moreover, unlike all other organs that are protein rich, the brain is lipid rich. Human milk has the least amount of protein compared with the milks of other large mammals but is rich in the essential fatty acids needed to continue brain development and growth. These essential fatty acids are required for proper dietary balance. The brain lipids are uniquely unsaturated and cannot be made de novo from glucose or protein but must be obtained in the diet. During early development, deficiency or imbalance in the dietary supply of lipids alters brain lipid composition and leads to lifelong impairment of brain function (6).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStephenson et al. (1) show that Malawian children who consumed reduced amounts of linoleic acid and a supplement of DHA performed better on the global Malawi Developmental Aptitude Test (MDAT), with the improvement driven in part by the social component. Notably, performance on the social component itself was significantly improved with increased consumption of balanced essential fatty acids, with or without DHA. In other studies, diets with excess linoleic acid fed to pregnant and lactating animals led to antisocial behaviors in the offspring in the form of anxiety and aggression (7) and impaired impulse control and hyperactivity in later life (8), in addition to impaired learning. In well-fed populations, results of omega-3 treatment in the form of EPA-DHA supplements, even without systematic reductions in the base dietary omega-6 linoleic acid, are promising and thus consistent with the preclinical data (9).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is noteworthy that the 6-mo interval between completion of bodily recovery from SAM and MDAT testing, with no intervention postrecovery, is important. Differences in circulating lipids due to the 3 different RUTF formulas would have disappeared within weeks as the recovered children resumed family foods at home. Long-term differences in brain structures are likely to have occurred due to the differences in essential fatty acids, as the flood of RUTF nutrients occurred with RUTF intake. Changes in higher brain functions have long been known to occur even from brief interruptions of essential fatty acid consumption in late gestation. The message here is that body growth is not a surrogate for brain growth. It is time to revise the paradigm for the treatment of malnutrition and indeed the strategies for nutrition and early human development, with a focus on the brain. The revision of strategy also applies to the importance of maternal nutrition and health before and during pregnancy including during breastfeeding, with its supreme importance for infant health and development.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeeding children well is an investment in global peace and prosperity. It is the brain which makes humans different from other animals, yet the nutrient requirements in the treatment of malnutrition have been overly focused on protein and body growth. The brain has missed out, yet it is the highest biological priority of early human development. This trial and other efforts (10) should help the nutrition community regain focus on the critical nature of neurodevelopment in health and disease.",

The primary outcomes, measured in a subset of subjects, were the Malawi Developmental Assessment Tool (MDAT) global and 4 domain (gross motor, fine motor, language and social) z-scores and a modified Willatts problem solving assessment (PSA) intention score for 3 standardized problems, measured 6 months and immediately after completing RUTF therapy, respectively. Plasma fatty acid content, anthropometry and eye tracking were secondary outcomes. Comparisons were made between the novel PUFA RUTFs and S-RUTF.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Among the 2565 SAM children enrolled, global MDAT z-score was -0.69 ± 1.19 and - 0.88 ± 1.27 for children receiving DHA-HO-RUTF and S-RUTF, respectively (difference 0.19, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.38). The gross motor and social domains had higher z-scores among children receiving either DHA-HO-RUTF than S-RUTF. The PSA problem 3 scores did not differ by dietary group (Odds ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.26 for DHA-HO-RUTF). After 4 weeks of treatment, plasma phospholipid EPA and α-linolenic acid were greater in children consuming DHA-HO-RUTF or HO-RUTF when compared to S-RUTF (for all 4 comparisons P values &amp;lt; 0.001), but only plasma DHA was greater in DHA-HO-RUTF than S-RUTF (P &amp;lt;0.001).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Conclusions&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Treatment of uncomplicated SAM with DHA-HO-RUTF resulted in an improved MDAT score, conferring a cognitive benefit six months after completing diet therapy. This treatment should be explored in operational settings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) afflicts up to 20 million children annually and has nearly always been considered mainly for its impairment of body growth and associated morbidity and mortality risks. In this issue of The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, Mark Manary of Washington University in St Louis, Tom Brenna of the University of Texas at Austin and Cornell University, and many coworkers present the first data showing that the fatty acids of lipid-rich ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTFs) are central to long-term brain recovery from SAM (1). Correcting excess ω-6 linoleic acid and deficits of ω-3 α-linolenic acid and DHA lead to sustained improved performance in developmental aptitude tests 6 months after the conclusion of successful treatment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as I am aware, this trial by Marcy et al. is the first to use cognition as a primary outcome in the treatment of severe acute malnutrition. For too long, malnutrition in Africa has been considered as just protein–calorie malnutrition. For example, Kwashiorkor has been treated with protein and calories, with a large portion of the calories coming from vegetable oils rich in linoleic acid, the parent essential fatty acid in the ω-6 family. Little thought seems to have been given to α-linolenic acid, an equivalent parent of the ω-3 family, despite the fact that their essentiality was established in the 1970s, with the need for a balance in the diet being referred to in a joint FAO/WHO expert consultation on “The Role of Dietary Oils and Fats in Human Nutrition” in 1976 (2). It has been well established that these 2 families of essential fatty acids use the same enzyme systems and too much of one competes against others, a process that is now understood on a genetic and molecular level (3). An excess of omega 6 linoleic acid suppresses tissue accretion of all omega 3 fatty acids. The metabolic demand for omega 3 induced by high linoleic acid consumption impairs development of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vegetable oils often contain high amounts of linoleic acid, which can reduce the bioavailability of omega 3 fats. This is of particular concern because the principal omega 3 product is DHA. This fatty acid is a vital component of the visual and neural receptors and signaling systems. The function of DHA in vision and the brain has been highly conserved since the origin of air-breathing animals (4, 5). Moreover, unlike all other organs that are protein rich, the brain is lipid rich. Human milk has the least amount of protein compared with the milks of other large mammals but is rich in the essential fatty acids needed to continue brain development and growth. These essential fatty acids are required for proper dietary balance. The brain lipids are uniquely unsaturated and cannot be made de novo from glucose or protein but must be obtained in the diet. During early development, deficiency or imbalance in the dietary supply of lipids alters brain lipid composition and leads to lifelong impairment of brain function (6).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stephenson et al. (1) show that Malawian children who consumed reduced amounts of linoleic acid and a supplement of DHA performed better on the global Malawi Developmental Aptitude Test (MDAT), with the improvement driven in part by the social component. Notably, performance on the social component itself was significantly improved with increased consumption of balanced essential fatty acids, with or without DHA. In other studies, diets with excess linoleic acid fed to pregnant and lactating animals led to antisocial behaviors in the offspring in the form of anxiety and aggression (7) and impaired impulse control and hyperactivity in later life (8), in addition to impaired learning. In well-fed populations, results of omega-3 treatment in the form of EPA-DHA supplements, even without systematic reductions in the base dietary omega-6 linoleic acid, are promising and thus consistent with the preclinical data (9).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is noteworthy that the 6-mo interval between completion of bodily recovery from SAM and MDAT testing, with no intervention postrecovery, is important. Differences in circulating lipids due to the 3 different RUTF formulas would have disappeared within weeks as the recovered children resumed family foods at home. Long-term differences in brain structures are likely to have occurred due to the differences in essential fatty acids, as the flood of RUTF nutrients occurred with RUTF intake. Changes in higher brain functions have long been known to occur even from brief interruptions of essential fatty acid consumption in late gestation. The message here is that body growth is not a surrogate for brain growth. It is time to revise the paradigm for the treatment of malnutrition and indeed the strategies for nutrition and early human development, with a focus on the brain. The revision of strategy also applies to the importance of maternal nutrition and health before and during pregnancy including during breastfeeding, with its supreme importance for infant health and development.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feeding children well is an investment in global peace and prosperity. It is the brain which makes humans different from other animals, yet the nutrient requirements in the treatment of malnutrition have been overly focused on protein and body growth. The brain has missed out, yet it is the highest biological priority of early human development. This trial and other efforts (10) should help the nutrition community regain focus on the critical nature of neurodevelopment in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I have been experimenting myself relentlessly with speeding that process up (as safely as possible). While searching for clues, I came across this study from 1959. It used monkeys and special diets (high PUFA or fat-free) to deplete and then replete PUFA from serum, cholesterol, and most importantly tissues.

Some takeaways from the study.  \n  \n&gt;1) On a fat-free diet, PUFA depletion in serum and cholesterol was daramatic and it took about 4 days to almost fully deplete PUFA.  \n2) In various tissues like muscle, skin and testis, PUFA depletion was slower, but still after ONLY 31 days the PUFA depletion in tissues reached the depletion levels seen in serum and cholesterol. As far as I can see PUFA levels fell to under 5% concentration in tissues. Again, this was achieved when feeding fat-free diet.  \n3) Perhaps the most important, and depressing finding - even a single high PUFA meal replenished PUFA content in serum, cholesterol and tissues almost up to the levels seen before starting fat-free diets. So, after depleting PUFA make sure to avoid even a single \"binge event\" of restaurant food unless you are loaded up on vitamin E.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Fat-free diets are unrealistic and maybe even unhealthy for many people. However, it is not hard to eat very low-fat diets with no more than 5% fat daily and feel fine. If the study translates to humans this probably means successful depletion of PUFA in as few as 2-3 months. I would appreciate it if someone else reads the study as well and tells me if I am reading this right. If this study is correct, I think it makes the Peatarian goals of being PUFA-free much more realistic. I know quite a few people that do not follow Peatarian diets ONLY b/c they are quite discouraged by the prospects of waiting 4+ years to see lasting benefits.  \nAnyways, please read and fire away.

(Background: I am seeing a naturopath because I’ve been dealing with acne for years and I’m trying to get to the root cause). \n\nI’ve been trying to avoid seed oils which is difficult enough, but now having to go dairy free is even more of a challenge. Finding dairy free cheese and butter without seed oils is near impossible. Since I’m only sensitive to the milk proteins and NOT lactose intolerant, I’ve been allowing myself to have sheeps milk products which makes it feel less restrictive (I would consider goat milk products but I hate the taste!) since that does not contain the same type of milk protein. \n\nAnyways - I’m trying to weigh out what is worse here, eating seed oils from time to time in dairy alternatives or just continuing to eat dairy so I can avoid seed oils more easily? \n\nI’m fed up with acne and almost willing to try anything but the seed oil AND dairy free diet is too restrictive for me :(",

(Background: I am seeing a naturopath because I’ve been dealing with acne for years and I’m trying to get to the root cause). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve been trying to avoid seed oils which is difficult enough, but now having to go dairy free is even more of a challenge. Finding dairy free cheese and butter without seed oils is near impossible. Since I’m only sensitive to the milk proteins and NOT lactose intolerant, I’ve been allowing myself to have sheeps milk products which makes it feel less restrictive (I would consider goat milk products but I hate the taste!) since that does not contain the same type of milk protein. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways - I’m trying to weigh out what is worse here, eating seed oils from time to time in dairy alternatives or just continuing to eat dairy so I can avoid seed oils more easily? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m fed up with acne and almost willing to try anything but the seed oil AND dairy free diet is too restrictive for me :(&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

  "selftext": "I've been avoiding seed oils for about 18 months now and figured I'd share my results with you guys. I'm a 22 year old Caucasian male with no major health issues aside from mild allergies and childhood asthma. I was overweight/obese as a child but lost weight and got fit through strength training and a more active lifestyle I started around 18. \n\nAnyways, I'd read some info about seed oils about 2 years ago and after looking into it decided to see how eliminating this food would affect my health. I've always been curious about ways to manipulate my health, having tried keto, intermittent fasting, eliminating sugar and other minor dietary adjustments. Of what I tried before eliminating sugar likely had the biggest impact on me, which now I think is due to causing me to avoid all processed food and by proxy a lot of seed oils. \n\nWhen I cut out seed oils I replaced most of the fats in my diet with butter, ghee, lard and olive oil. The most immediate change I noticed, within the first two weeks, was I no longer had cravings for snack foods, and hunger became much more manageable, even while eating carbs/sugars (fruit, honey and maple syrup🇨🇦). The few times I would eat seed oils, such as going to a restaurant or eating baked sweets friends made for me, I'd get the same snack cravings two to three hours after eating them. I can confidently say that seed oils, more than sugar, were the main cause of mindless snacking/eating for me. \n\nAfter about three months, I noticed more subtle health improvements. The chronic congestion Id experienced much of my life cleared up, and I was easily breathing through my nose. My sense of smell and taste improved accordingly. As well, my skin quality improved a lot, and I've had almost no issues with dry skin, rashes, breakouts etc. Historically I had very dry skin, especially in the winter, so this was a welcome improvement. As well, I'm much more resistant to UV light now, and can spend several hours in the summer sun without sunscreen, and will rarely burn, when before I'd be bright red after an hour on the beach. \n\nAfter my experiment, I've decided to stick with a low seed oil/PUFA diet. It's had by far the biggest results for me, and I can adjust my calories/carbs up and down easily to build muscle or lose fat, while maintaining the benefits of this diet. It's more difficult to follow than the low carb diets I'd tried before, but the results are better and it allows me to eat more foods, as long as I'm cooking then myself. Let me know if you've got any more questions, but I'm happy to say that removing seed oils has been one of the best things I've done for my health.",

  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been avoiding seed oils for about 18 months now and figured I&amp;#39;d share my results with you guys. I&amp;#39;m a 22 year old Caucasian male with no major health issues aside from mild allergies and childhood asthma. I was overweight/obese as a child but lost weight and got fit through strength training and a more active lifestyle I started around 18. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I&amp;#39;d read some info about seed oils about 2 years ago and after looking into it decided to see how eliminating this food would affect my health. I&amp;#39;ve always been curious about ways to manipulate my health, having tried keto, intermittent fasting, eliminating sugar and other minor dietary adjustments. Of what I tried before eliminating sugar likely had the biggest impact on me, which now I think is due to causing me to avoid all processed food and by proxy a lot of seed oils. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I cut out seed oils I replaced most of the fats in my diet with butter, ghee, lard and olive oil. The most immediate change I noticed, within the first two weeks, was I no longer had cravings for snack foods, and hunger became much more manageable, even while eating carbs/sugars (fruit, honey and maple syrup🇨🇦). The few times I would eat seed oils, such as going to a restaurant or eating baked sweets friends made for me, I&amp;#39;d get the same snack cravings two to three hours after eating them. I can confidently say that seed oils, more than sugar, were the main cause of mindless snacking/eating for me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After about three months, I noticed more subtle health improvements. The chronic congestion Id experienced much of my life cleared up, and I was easily breathing through my nose. My sense of smell and taste improved accordingly. As well, my skin quality improved a lot, and I&amp;#39;ve had almost no issues with dry skin, rashes, breakouts etc. Historically I had very dry skin, especially in the winter, so this was a welcome improvement. As well, I&amp;#39;m much more resistant to UV light now, and can spend several hours in the summer sun without sunscreen, and will rarely burn, when before I&amp;#39;d be bright red after an hour on the beach. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After my experiment, I&amp;#39;ve decided to stick with a low seed oil/PUFA diet. It&amp;#39;s had by far the biggest results for me, and I can adjust my calories/carbs up and down easily to build muscle or lose fat, while maintaining the benefits of this diet. It&amp;#39;s more difficult to follow than the low carb diets I&amp;#39;d tried before, but the results are better and it allows me to eat more foods, as long as I&amp;#39;m cooking then myself. Let me know if you&amp;#39;ve got any more questions, but I&amp;#39;m happy to say that removing seed oils has been one of the best things I&amp;#39;ve done for my health.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

  "selftext": "I've been looking for ways to optimize saturated fat intake. Since cheese is among my favorite snacks, I was looking at cheese varieties that have high saturated fat content. These three are my favorites:\n\n1. **Dutch Aged Gouda (12+ months)** is the only cheese made with no other milk besides whole milk; every other type of cheese either removes some cream from the milk or adds skim milk. This means that Gouda has the potential to be the fattiest cheese (there are other factors). If you buy it in Holland, it is out-of-this-world good. Sadly, even the pricier stuff they export to the US is below average compared what you can buy in The Netherlands, but it's still very good cheese. Dutch dairy products are all from pasture-raised, grass-fed, grass-finished cows. It gets 70% to 80% of its calories from fat, and when aged usually has between 45% &amp; 50% fat by weight; about 64% of this is saturated, and only 3.8% is PUFA. (this amounts to about 2% of total energy by mass). (Note: If you buy unpasteurized Gouda in Holland, it will be Baby Gouda that hasn't been aged long, so it will only be around 38% to 40% fat. It's still out-of-this-world good.)\n2. **Dubliner** is an Irish cheese that's like a cross between cheddar and Parmesan. Irish dairy practices are pasture &amp; grass-based, and it says \"grass-fed\" on the label, but I was unable to find specific information about whether it's what we call \"grass-finished.\" It gets 74% of its calories from fat, and is 56% fat by weight; about 67% of this is saturated. I couldn't find any information on PUFA/MUFA content.\n3. **Italian Parmesan** (AKA Parmigiano Reggiano) tastes like candy to me. This is not the grated or shredded stuff, but the hard stuff that you buy wrapped in clear plastic that  has been cut from a wheel and is sold by weight. The good news is that Italy exports pretty good Parmesan to the US, though it's still nowhere near as good as what you can find in Italy. It gets around 60% of its calories from fat, and is usually around 40% fat by weight; about 60% to 65% is saturated, and only about 2% is PUFA (this amounts to a little less than 1% of total energy by mass).\n\nThe numbers above are approximations based on the nutritional labels of stuff in my fridge and information I found on the internet. So it pretty much has to be true, right? Just kidding. If anyone else has better numbers or can fill in the missing information about Dubliner, that would be great.\n\nI'd love to hear what other people's favorite low-PUFA, high-saturated-fat cheeses are.",

Anyway, the precise actions of ?-3PUFAs in skeletal muscle are overlooked. We hypothesized that PUFAs, modulating mitochondrial function and efficiency, would ameliorate pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant signs of nutritionally induced obesity.\n\nStudy Design\nTo this aim, rats were fed a control diet (CD) or isocaloric high fat diets containing either ?-3 PUFA (FD) or lard (LD) for 6 weeks.\n\nResults\nFD rats showed lower weight, lipid gain and energy efficiency compared to LD-fed animals, showing higher energy expenditure and O2 consumption/CO2 production. Serum lipid profile and pro-inflammatory parameters in FD-fed animals were reduced compared to LD. Accordingly, FD rats exhibited a higher glucose tolerance revealed by an improved glucose and insulin tolerance tests compared to LD, accompanied by a restoration of insulin signalling in skeletal muscle. PUFAs increased lipid oxidation and reduced energy efficiency in subsarcolemmal mitochondria, and increase AMPK activation, reducing both endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stress. Increased mitochondrial respiration was related to an increased mitochondriogenesis in FD skeletal muscle, as shown by the increase in PGC1-a and -ß.\n\nConclusions\nour data strengthened the association of high dietary ?3-PUFA intake with reduced mitochondrial energy efficiency in the skeletal muscle.\n\n\nsource:  https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0149033\n&amp;#x200B;  (full open access)\n\n-----------------------------\n\nResults\nFD rats showed lower weight, lipid gain and energy efficiency compared to LD-fed animals, showing higher energy expenditure and O2 consumption/CO2 production.

PUFAs increased lipid oxidation and reduced energy efficiency in subsarcolemmal mitochondria, and increase AMPK activation, reducing both endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stress. Increased mitochondrial respiration was related to an increased mitochondriogenesis in FD skeletal muscle, as shown by the increase in PGC1-a and -ß.\n\nIn conclusion, our data strengthened the capability of high dietary PUFA intake to reduce fat mass and insulin resistance associated to fat overnutrition, modulating energy efficiency. In particular, at skeletal muscle level, ω-3 PUFAs enriched diet promotes inefficient metabolism, generating heat instead of ATP, increases lipid oxidation, activating the pathway AMPK/ACC, and reduces ROS generation in mitochondria. Therefore, modulating mitochondrial function and efficiency in the skeletal muscle, they lessen pro-inflammatory, pro-oxidant signs and insulin resistance also in condition of nutritionally-induced obesity.\n\nFull paper at\nsource:  https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0149033\n&amp;#x200B;  (full open access)",

Anyway, the precise actions of ?-3PUFAs in skeletal muscle are overlooked. We hypothesized that PUFAs, modulating mitochondrial function and efficiency, would ameliorate pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant signs of nutritionally induced obesity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Study Design\nTo this aim, rats were fed a control diet (CD) or isocaloric high fat diets containing either ?-3 PUFA (FD) or lard (LD) for 6 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Results\nFD rats showed lower weight, lipid gain and energy efficiency compared to LD-fed animals, showing higher energy expenditure and O2 consumption/CO2 production. Serum lipid profile and pro-inflammatory parameters in FD-fed animals were reduced compared to LD. Accordingly, FD rats exhibited a higher glucose tolerance revealed by an improved glucose and insulin tolerance tests compared to LD, accompanied by a restoration of insulin signalling in skeletal muscle. PUFAs increased lipid oxidation and reduced energy efficiency in subsarcolemmal mitochondria, and increase AMPK activation, reducing both endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stress. Increased mitochondrial respiration was related to an increased mitochondriogenesis in FD skeletal muscle, as shown by the increase in PGC1-a and -ß.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Conclusions\nour data strengthened the association of high dietary ?3-PUFA intake with reduced mitochondrial energy efficiency in the skeletal muscle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;source:  &lt;a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0149033\"&gt;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0149033&lt;/a&gt;\n&amp;#x200B;  (full open access)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Results\nFD rats showed lower weight, lipid gain and energy efficiency compared to LD-fed animals, showing higher energy expenditure and O2 consumption/CO2 production.

      "selftext": "This is a summary post of Brad Marshall's series on his blog: [fireinabottle.net](https://fireinabottle.net). It's a theory of the cause of the obesity epidemic. I found it very interesting and everything fits together for me. If anyone can think of counterexamples or refutations, I'd love to know about them.\n\n**TLDR:**  Burning long-chain saturated fats in mitochondria creates reactive oxygen species (ROS) to a degree that burning sugars and unsaturated fats do not. These ROS serve as a signal to the cell to stop taking in energy. This signal is especially important in fat cells and in the hypothalamus for maintaining satiety and balancing energy intake. While ROS can cause damage to proteins and DNA, biological systems have mechanisms to handle them easily. ROS concentration is correlated with longevity in model organisms.\n\n**Actionable advice:** Avoid unsaturated fats, particularly from non-tropical plant oils (soy, corn, canola, sunflower, peanut, etc.) and consume more saturated fats. Minimize sugars, but other carbs are acceptable. Alcohol is acceptable in moderation. Milkfat (butter, cream), cocoa butter, coconut oil, tallow, and palm oil are good. French fries cooked in coconut oil or tallow are fine. Vegetables are good but fruits are iffy.\n\n#**The ROS Theory of Obesity**\n\nI've always felt that the various theories of the cause of the obesity epidemic were unsatisfactory. Low carb high-fat diets seem to induce weight loss, but there are lean populations with low-fat white rice diets. Sugar is not a health food, but populations with relatively high sugar intake (Hadza, French before 1970, Americans before 1900) stayed lean and free of heart disease.\n\nI recently found the following series of blog posts by Brad Marshall, and his ROS theory of obesity seems to make sense of the evidence:\n\n- Why low fat diets maintain leanness in some populations\n- Why low carb diets seem to work in the US but low fat diets don't for most people\n- Why some populations with high sugar intake stay lean\n- Why western foods appear to be particularly obesogenic\n- Why heart disease, stroke, cancer, obesity, diabetes have only been a problem for a century or so\n\n[The ROS Theory of Obesity](https://fireinabottle.net/the-ros-theory-of-obesity/)\n\nA theory of obesity should explain what's seen in different populations, current and historic. High carb and high fat diets have maintained lean populations. Even the French diet pre-1970s, which included lots of white flour, butter, and sugar.\nCompeting theories:\n\n- High carb causes obesity: Contradicted by Chinese diet pre 1980 where 80% of calories came from refined starch (white rice)\n\n- Food reward causes obesity: French diet pre 1970 kept people slim on: white flour, sugar, butter, cheese, meat, wine\n\nTheory: ROS are generated from the oxidation of saturated fats by mitochondria. These serve as a signal telling the cell to ignore insulin and stop taking in nutrients. The series looks at the molecular mechanisms of metabolism, how ROS are created, and why the obesity epidemic happened.\n\n[The mitochondria](https://fireinabottle.net/the-mitochondria/)\n\nMitochondria maintain a voltage and pH gradient between two membranes. The chemical energy of this gradient is used to produce ATP from ADP. ATP is the energy currency of the cell. This post goes into the biochemical details of how that works.\n\n[A highly conserved molecular bottleneck](https://fireinabottle.net/a-highly-conserved-molecular-bottleneck/)\n\nWhen sugar metabolism is blocked in C. elegans, it switches to fat metabolism. This creates more ROS, and the worm's lifespan increases. Why?\nMitochondrial membranes have 2 protein complexes for transferring electrons and creating a chemical gradient, Complex I and Complex II. Glucose burning uses Complex I over II in a 5:1 ratio. Long chain saturated fatty acids use Complex I over II in a 2:1 ratio. The closer ratio means both complexes are comparably active, and more electrons are being transferred than the next step (coenzyme Q) can handle. These extra electrons are rejected and create ROS in the cytoplasm. This bottleneck is highly conserved in all eukaryotes from yeast to humans. The result of elevated ROS is that the cell becomes reversibly resistant to the signal from insulin: physiological insulin resistance.\n\n[Physiological insulin resistance](https://fireinabottle.net/physiological-insulin-resistance/)\n\nAfter a starchy meal, the bloodstream has high glucose and high insulin. Cells respond to insulin and take in glucose. At some point, the mitochondrial gradient is full and the cell has enough ATP. Electron transfer into Complex I and II is more difficult and electrons are rejected. This creates ROS such as superoxide. This is a signal that its energy requirements are met and it should stop taking in nutrients. This is called physiological insulin resistance. It happens with every meal. ROS is the signal by which cells control their energy intake.\n\n[This is what fat burning looks like](https://fireinabottle.net/this-is-what-fat-burning-looks-like/)\n\nMicrographs of mitochondria metabolizing a high stearic acid meal: They tend to fuse together.\n\n[Saturated fat causes physiological insulin resistance in humans](https://fireinabottle.net/saturated-fat-causes-physiological-insulin-resistance-in-humans/)\n\nA study comparing carbohydrate feeding vs. saturated fat feeding for 24h. People who ate the saturated fat maintained higher blood sugar during an insulin suppression test. This phenomenon reversed with a switch back to a higher carb diet.\n\n[Unsaturated fat prevents physiological insulin resistance in humans](https://fireinabottle.net/unsaturated-fat-prevents-physiological-insulin-resistance-in-humans/)\n\nComparison of two low-carb diets, one with high saturated fat versus one with high unsaturated fat. The saturated fat diet created physiological insulin resistance, while the unsaturated fat maintained insulin sensitivity. Why? Because the double bonds in unsaturated fat are oxidized in a way such that Complex II is not activated as much. There is less of a bottleneck at coenzyme Q and not enough electrons are rejected to create as much ROS.\n\n[The amount of polyunsaturated fat in the modern American diet fattens up mice without additional calories](https://fireinabottle.net/the-amount-of-polyunsaturated-fat-in-the-modern-american-diet-fattens-up-mice-without-additional-calories/)\n\nSummary of a study with a mouse strain known to get fat on a high fat diet. Though all groups ate equivalent amounts of calories, the one with higher unsaturated fat consumption gained weight and fat.\n\n[Long chain saturated fat causes fat loss in mice](https://fireinabottle.net/long-chain-saturated-fat-causes-fat-loss-in-mice/)\n\nSummary of two mouse studies showing that diets with similar fat contents, but different amounts of saturated fat, produced different results. High stearic acid (a long chain saturated fat) resulted in higher lean mass and lower fat mass compared to diets high in unsaturated fats.\n\n[Butter causes a high level of available energy 8 hours after a meal](https://fireinabottle.net/butter-causes-a-high-level-of-available-energy-8-hours-after-a-meal/)\n\nFat cells respond to insulin by:\n\n- Stopping lipolysis of stored fat\n- Taking in glucose and fatty acids and storing them\n\nThis post summarizes a study in which humans were give isocaloric fatty meals of butter or other fats. The butter group maintained the highest serum free fatty acids and triglycerides for up to 8 hours. This indicates that fat cells refused to take in and store the available energy. The assumption is that the higher available energy promotes satiety.\n\n[The loss of SCD1 prevents obesity in mice](https://fireinabottle.net/the-loss-of-scd1-prevents-obesity-in-mice/)\n\nSCD1 is a gene that codes for the enzyme steroyl-CoA desaturase. This enzyme converts saturated fat to monounsaturated fat. Mice with SCD1 knocked out maintain leanness throughout life and have a high metabolic rate. Humans tend to maintain a 1:1 ratio of SFA and MUFA when storing fat, so this enzyme is upregulated as needed. When stored fat is metabolized, this 1:1 ratio produces a moderate amount of ROS. SCD1 is upregulated in response to dietary sugar. Sugar intake therefore leads to less ROS.\n\n[The body fat of obese adults is highly unsaturated](https://fireinabottle.net/the-body-fat-of-obese-adults-is-highly-unsaturated/)\n\nStored body fat in obese adults is more unsaturated. This may explain why obese adults have a hard time losing weight: Less ROS created when stored fat is being used. It may be that obese people express SCD1 more and may be why they gained weight in the first place.\n\n[ROS is satiation](https://fireinabottle.net/ros-is-satiation/)\n\nSatiation is triggered in the hypothalamus. Infusing fat into rats' bloodstreams caused cells in the hypothalamus to burn fat and create ROS. The rats reduced food intake after the infusion. Infusing fat into the bloodstream along with powerful antioxidants to mop up the ROS did not result in reduced food intake.\n\n[Three countries study](https://fireinabottle.net/the-three-countries-study/)\n\nOverview of diets in 1980s china, 1970s France, and modern America, and how ROS signalling explains their respective waistlines.\n\n[Introducing the croissant diet](https://fireinabottle.net/introducing-the-croissant-diet/)\n\nAuthor's application of his findings.\n\n[The Croissant Diet specification](https://fireinabottle.net/the-croissant-diet-specification/)\n\nDetailed specification of the diet.\n\nEdit: formatting",

High stearic acid (a long chain saturated fat) resulted in higher lean mass and lower fat mass compared to diets high in unsaturated fats.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://fireinabottle.net/butter-causes-a-high-level-of-available-energy-8-hours-after-a-meal/\"&gt;Butter causes a high level of available energy 8 hours after a meal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fat cells respond to insulin by:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Stopping lipolysis of stored fat&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Taking in glucose and fatty acids and storing them&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This post summarizes a study in which humans were give isocaloric fatty meals of butter or other fats. The butter group maintained the highest serum free fatty acids and triglycerides for up to 8 hours. This indicates that fat cells refused to take in and store the available energy. The assumption is that the higher available energy promotes satiety.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://fireinabottle.net/the-loss-of-scd1-prevents-obesity-in-mice/\"&gt;The loss of SCD1 prevents obesity in mice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SCD1 is a gene that codes for the enzyme steroyl-CoA desaturase. This enzyme converts saturated fat to monounsaturated fat. Mice with SCD1 knocked out maintain leanness throughout life and have a high metabolic rate. Humans tend to maintain a 1:1 ratio of SFA and MUFA when storing fat, so this enzyme is upregulated as needed. When stored fat is metabolized, this 1:1 ratio produces a moderate amount of ROS. SCD1 is upregulated in response to dietary sugar. Sugar intake therefore leads to less ROS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://fireinabottle.net/the-body-fat-of-obese-adults-is-highly-unsaturated/\"&gt;The body fat of obese adults is highly unsaturated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stored body fat in obese adults is more unsaturated. This may explain why obese adults have a hard time losing weight: Less ROS created when stored fat is being used. It may be that obese people express SCD1 more and may be why they gained weight in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://fireinabottle.net/ros-is-satiation/\"&gt;ROS is satiation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Satiation is triggered in the hypothalamus. Infusing fat into rats&amp;#39; bloodstreams caused cells in the hypothalamus to burn fat and create ROS. The rats reduced food intake after the infusion. Infusing fat into the bloodstream along with powerful antioxidants to mop up the ROS did not result in reduced food intake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://fireinabottle.net/the-three-countries-study/\"&gt;Three countries study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overview of diets in 1980s china, 1970s France, and modern America, and how ROS signalling explains their respective waistlines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://fireinabottle.net/introducing-the-croissant-diet/\"&gt;Introducing the croissant diet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Author&amp;#39;s application of his findings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://fireinabottle.net/the-croissant-diet-specification/\"&gt;The Croissant Diet specification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Detailed specification of the diet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: formatting&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

It’s got a slightly “beefy” flavor but I have to say I am very happy with it and excited to have bacon back on the menu. 🙂\n\nIt isn’t grass-fed but 95% of the beef we eat is, so I consider it an acceptable splurge. It’s also expensive at almost $1/slice (LOL) but hey, we honestly don’t eat it that much.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to pass this discovery on for anyone really wanting a bacon fix. Search your local Whole Foods to see if they have it!",

It’s got a slightly “beefy” flavor but I have to say I am very happy with it and excited to have bacon back on the menu. 🙂&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It isn’t grass-fed but 95% of the beef we eat is, so I consider it an acceptable splurge. It’s also expensive at almost $1/slice (LOL) but hey, we honestly don’t eat it that much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I just wanted to pass this discovery on for anyone really wanting a bacon fix. Search your local Whole Foods to see if they have it!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
