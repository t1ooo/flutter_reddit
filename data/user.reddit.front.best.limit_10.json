  "selftext": "I got my first one a couple years ago. I wasn't thinking, had a late afternoon coffee, smoked a little weed then had a damn margarita with dinner. My kid starts throwing food and I tried to reprimand him. BOOM! heart rate spikes for maybe 5 min. I'd say in excess of 200 BPM which is super scary.\n\nBut it started happening once in a while afterwords. Like I'd go months without having one and then 2-3 in a week then they'd go away again. I do have a VSD heat murmer as well as regular palpitations since I was a kid. The doctors always said it was nothing to worry about. But I got super worried as I'm in my early 40s now and I was worried something had changed, so I looked it up. The only thing online that describes what I'm going through is a panic attack. But the high heart rate is the only real symptom. I wouldn't say I'm getting any of the other symptoms associated with a panic attack. I mean yea the sense of impending doom, but not like a general anxiety feeling of doom. It's because my heart is hammering away in my chest for no reason. \n\nBut it kept happening. Random clusters of them with months spaced in between. I'd lay down and try to breath. Drinking cold water seemed to help. It would last in between 5-10min and I'd be fine. They'd go away and I'd just forget about going to the doctor. \n\nBut then 2 things happened. I had 2 hernias that were becoming a problem. Caused me to stop working out. Then some events happened in the field of work I'm in, causing my profession to become a never ending hellscape of stress. I had a couple of MEGA episodes that lasted longer than 10 min. That's when I finally linked it to stress. Now I've always been really good at managing my stress. I never \"feel\" particularly anxious. I've always been really good about forgetting my work problems shortly after I clock off (that show \"Severed\" on apple+ reminds me of my life in a huge way). But the stress is obviously getting to me. It must be still there just bubbling under the surface even though I felt fine.\n\nI've also linked it to smoking weed. Like if I'm swamped at work and I smoke a Sativa (I suspect it's not an issue with Indicas) when I get home I might get an episode. So I try to be super careful with it. But man I friggin love weed, A doctor would have to tell me it was going to kill me before I'd stop.\n\nMy work got slow again and the panic attacks went mostly away. I went in to get my double hernia surgery and spent a month in bed. Got super out of shape and gained a bunch of weight. One of the first things I did when I was on my feet again was to go golfing. My dumb ass forgets his hat and starts slamming beers on the golf course. BOOM! heat stroke. I made it home and recovered. But I ended up having a series of panic attacks from that all in the same day, friggin sucked.\n\nSo I finally make appt. with my doctor. Told him the whole history. Right away he schedules a battery of tests. Got the EKG, ECG, halter monitor, blood work. The whole 9 yards. Everything comes back fine. The palpitations and murmer are still benign. Says I'm healthy as a horse. He told me to start exercising again and prescribed some beta blockers. But only to take them if I felt I needed them. I didn't fill that prescription right away. Decided to wait and see if I could try managing my stress through exercise again. \n\nFast forward a few months, work starts to pick up again. We finished a project for one of my customers but I can't get ahold of him so that he can pay the bill. Finally his wife calls me. Tells me her husband is in the hospital dying of Covid and he's likely not going to make it. So I have to arrange for this lady to pay a huge bill while she's going through this major traumatic life experience. I also felt like I got hit in the gut too when I heard that. I'd been working with the guy for nearly a year. We got along well. I remember one time we both had our shirts up comparing surgery scars. Nice dude. Anyway I hang up the phone and BOOM! Mega panic attack from hell. This was the worst one ever. 15 min in I was starting to think I was going to die. I was working from home and I always avoid telling my wife about them because I don't want to worry her. But it was bad enough for me to tell her this time. I needed her to make the decision if we needed to call an ambulance. But we laid down in bed and she stroked my hair and tried to take my mind off it. My heart was probably going like 210 and super hard. But she managed to get it down to around maybe 190 and less intensely. But it's 20min in now. She tells me to try taking a shower. This worked fairly well. But it was a gradual decline. usually my panic attacks stop abruptly. My heart rate wasn't back to 80 for a solid 30min. \n\nI went and got the beta blockers that evening. Been on them ever since. And they really seem to help. I just take a low dose in the afternoon every day. My work is back to being nuts and I haven't had an issue. So at least I have a solution, for now. \n\nI don't want to be on the beta blockers forever so I'd like to find a way to re-wire my brain and get off them. Anyone got any advice or similar experience? I feel like I'm not a typical case for panic attacks. For me it's like I feel fine, then something triggers \"fight or flight\" in my brain for seemingly no reason. I mean I'm sure it's anxiety and stress but it only manifests in these high heart rate episodes. Nothing else.",

So at least I have a solution, for now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to be on the beta blockers forever so I&amp;#39;d like to find a way to re-wire my brain and get off them. Anyone got any advice or similar experience? I feel like I&amp;#39;m not a typical case for panic attacks. For me it&amp;#39;s like I feel fine, then something triggers &amp;quot;fight or flight&amp;quot; in my brain for seemingly no reason. I mean I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s anxiety and stress but it only manifests in these high heart rate episodes. Nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

In particular, at skeletal muscle level, ω-3 PUFAs enriched diet promotes inefficient metabolism, generating heat instead of ATP, increases lipid oxidation, activating the pathway AMPK/ACC, and reduces ROS generation in mitochondria. Therefore, modulating mitochondrial function and efficiency in the skeletal muscle, they lessen pro-inflammatory, pro-oxidant signs and insulin resistance also in condition of nutritionally-induced obesity.\n\nFull paper at\nsource:  https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0149033\n&amp;#x200B;  (full open access)",

I have felt like i’ve been going crazy for the past 3 months because every time I go to get checked my tests all come back perfectly fine. \nGot boosted in early November - end of November had a bad outbreak of hives that lasted over 6 weeks. Couldn’t find an environmental trigger so I lived on Claritin and Benadryl for nearly two months. I saw my immunologist and everything came back clear, we figured it was an unknown environmental trigger that caused chronic hives. In December I began getting ocular migraines where I would get a blind spot for 30-45min followed by a migraine. In January the palpitations started, followed by chest tightness and pain. The pain has always been random and never prompted by stress or exercise. At this point I went to the ER and then my PCP, where my EKG and blood tests looked perfectly normal but still got a 24h holter. Nothing overly concerning showed up. Went on a work exchange for two months where I continued having palpitations and pain but really tried to keep myself calm because I was very far from home. My anxiety was through the roof this whole time, thinking I was going to have a heart attack or die in my sleep. I also had odd sensations in my legs and feet (tingling, warm sensations) and what felt like growing pains, as well as occasional burning in my arms and hands. Fast forward to nearly two weeks ago, the brain fog and derealization kicked into overdrive. I really thought I was losing my mind. I also started having brain zaps which scared the hell out of me. I got brain zaps several years ago after weaning off of LexaPro, but this time they are completely unprompted and really disorienting. I am also experiencing some joint pain and stiffness in my back, hips, and neck. Also to note I am 25 years old, relatively active, and eat pretty clean. \nNo longer having hives or migraines, and my palpitations seem a bit softer and less frequent than the past few months.

From the little bit I've read this is primarily due to alchohols interference in the citrc acid cycle.\n\nHowever, I've noticed using other drugs such as 2m2b, gabapentinoids, and benzodiazapines seem to not have a noticeable impact on my endurance or lifting capability.
