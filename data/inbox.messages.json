    "body": "Welcome to r/zerocarb.\n\nOur definition of zerocarb is a carnivorous diet. We only eat meat and animal products. We do not consume plants for nutrients or calories. Some animal products contain carbs (e.g. dairy), most of those are acceptable. Some plant products contain no carbs (e.g. plant oils), and those are generally not acceptable.\n\nAre you interested in trying a carnivore/zerocarb way of eating? Do you have simple questions about it? You can ask here. Vegetarians and vegans can post in this thread without an automatic ban, so long as they are asking honest questions and not trying to promote plant-based diets or spread misinformation about the dangers of meat.\n\nThe term 'zerocarb' is historical and dates back to Owsley \"The Bear\" Stanley. While many members choose to also use other terms, like carnivore, we will always consider ourselves zerocarb.\n\nIf you are really interested in eating this way, you should read \"The Fat of the Land\" and \"Bear's Words of Wisdom.\" They are both pinned to the top of the subreddit in the Free PDFs dropdown. These are considered required reading.\n\nWe do not have a reddit chat, but there is a place if you want a live chat: u/LogicalLynx runs it on discord: https://discord.gg/CR9gPvp\n\nCheck the Let's Get Started: Beginner Questions and Answers FAQ Thread for how to get started.\nPurpose\nThis subreddit exists to:\n\nprovide information about the zerocarb way of eating\n\nprovide support for those eating zerocarb and those who want to try or are trying, to eat zerocarb\n\nprovide a community for zerocarbers to interact and share experiences\n\nWe are not a debate subreddit. There are plenty of places for you to discuss the health benefits of consuming plants. This is not the place. We have heard it all before. If you are not on a zerocarb diet or transitioning to one, you are not guaranteed a right to participate here. Yes, that means we reserve the right to ban people just for being vegans, vegetarians, or bots (which don't eat and thus aren't zerocarb). If you are veg*n, you may only post in threads tagged \"VEG*NS ALLOWED.\" If you post elsewhere, you can be banned.\n\nThe focus of this subreddit is on eating an all-animal-products diet. Conversations about unrelated topics may be deleted as they are not appropriate here. Conversations about other ways of eating, even conversations about how those ways of eating are misguided, are not appropriate here. It is not the purpose of this subreddit to attack or mock other ways of eating.\n\nThis subreddit makes the assumption that you are an intelligent adult and capable of making your own health choices. We are wary of making recommendations towards children and teens. If you are interested in an all-meat diet for your child or you are a teen who is interested, we encourage you to work directly with a medical professional.\n\nIf you are interested in a meat-heavy diet, one which is almost carnivore but includes some plant foods, which don't cause you issues, this is not the appropriate place to have those conversations. There are two potential subreddits that were created to host those discussions. We have r/carnivorish and r/dirtycarnivores. Those subreddits are currently small, but you can help them grow. A responsible person who helps those subreddits become thriving communities will be considered for a moderator position there.\n\nThere are lifestyle choices that you may believe are related to eating this way, but there is nothing universal here except the avoidance of plant foods. Those discussions are best when held in subreddits that are appropriate for them.\n\nWe are not an extreme weight loss subreddit\nWeight normalization will happen with zerocarb. If you are overweight, you will reach a healthy weight. If you are underweight, you will also reach a healthy weight. Weight normalization is just a symptom of the primary goal. We are about long-term health and wellness. This isn't \"extreme keto\" where you get double your weight loss for extreme carb denial.\n\nWe discourage messages advocating or encouraging food and calorie restriction, even subtle messages of this manner. Do not tell people they need to eat less. Do not tell people they are eating too much. Don't tell people they gained weight because they ate too much or lost weight because they were eating less. This is not a debatable subject. We don't host CICO discussions here.\n\nFrom the Bear's Thread:\n\nI do advise however, that fasting and severely low caloric intake is NOT a very good idea for your health.[. . .]The meat regime does not require fasting, which is what 1100 cal/day is. You can eat 5000 cal/day and lose bodyfat. You are eating far too little. Eat 80% (cal) in fat, 20% (cal) in lean. This is instinctive. Don’t measure. Choose a nice fatty cut of meat, cook very little (blood rare or bleu), eat mostly of the fat at first, until you don’t feel like any more fat (built-in response), then eat the lean until satiated. Save any left-overs in the fridge for later.‘\n\n----\n\nThis message can not be replied to.
